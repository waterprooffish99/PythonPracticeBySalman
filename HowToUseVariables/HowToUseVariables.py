# name = "ZyshaHuda"

# print(name)

# age = 7

# print("I am " + str(age) + " years old.")

# #or 

# print(f"I am {name} and I am {age} years old.")


# name = "clHuda"

# age = 4

# print("I am" + str(age) + " years old.")

# print(f"I am {name} and I am {age} years old.")

x = 10

y = "10"

print(x + y)  # it throws an error because python doesn't support adding an integer and string. to Fix this below is the code,

print(x + int(y)) # now it workd fine,,,,
