'''Operators in Python!'''

'''Assignment Operators'''

'''
Assignment operators are used to store or update a value in a variable.
The most common one is =, but there are others for doing math while assigning.

x = 5       # Simple assignment, stores 5 in x
x += 3      # Adds 3 to x, same as x = x + 3 (Now x is 8)
x -= 2      # Subtracts 2 from x, same as x = x - 2 (Now x is 6)
x *= 4      # Multiplies x by 4, same as x = x * 4 (Now x is 24)
x /= 2      # Divides x by 2, same as x = x / 2 (Now x is 12.0)
x %= 5      # Stores the remainder of x divided by 5 (Now x is 2.0)


#below are the little practices...


a = 7
a += 3

print(a)

a = 7
a -= 3

print(a)

a = 7
a *= 3

print(a)

a = 7
a /= 3

print(a)

a = 7
a %= 3

print (a)

a = 7
a **= 3

print(a)
