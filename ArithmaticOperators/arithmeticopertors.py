# Arithmetic Operators

print(13 + 35)    # Addition: Adds 13 and 35

print(49 - 64)    # Subtraction: Subtracts 64 from 49

print(74 * 3)     # Multiplication: Multiplies 74 by 3

print(54 / 2)     # Division: Divides 54 by 2 (gives a float result)

print(73 % 2)     # Modulus: Gives the remainder when 73 is divided by 2


# The double asterisk (**) is the exponentiation operator in Python.
# This program is calculating 22 raised to the power of 3 (22^3).
# It multiplies 22 by itself 3 times: 22 * 22 * 22 = 10648.
print(22 ** 3)
